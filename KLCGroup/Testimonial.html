                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>What a great team. From the first enquiry to the job being completed they were so helpful, fair on
                    price and superb with the work. They were punctual, clean and tidy workers, nothing was too much
                    trouble. It reminded me of the days when workers took pride in what the did and Shaun was
                    brilliant.. Would l recommend them, without any doubt. We are so happy with there work, Thank you
                    Shaun and Richard.</p>

                <h2>Testimonial by Elizabeth Groves</h2>
                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>We have just had the pleasure of Richard and his team insulating and boarding our loft, which was carried out quickly and efficiently. From the outset, Richard has been a pleasure to deal with, always keeping us fully informed of what he intended to do, arriving on time and removing any mess made. He is a very pleasant young man who, I feel, takes a pride in his and his team's work and offers an excellent service. We are extremely pleased, so much so that he is returning in the New Year to carry out further work for us. I have no hesitation in recommending KLC Group and know that anyone managing to book his services will not be disappointed. 5*</p>

                <h2>Testimonial by Steve Cameron</h2>
                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>Service privided - loft insulation. Following a water leak in our loft we needed part of the loft to
                    be re-insulated. Richard responded very promptly to our request for a quote and the cost was very
                    competitive. The work was completed within a few days of asking for the quote. There was no mess,
                    and we are very pleased with the quality of the work. Richard was very helpful and Sean, who did the
                    installation work for us, was a clean worker, very helpful and very polite. We are happy to award a
                    5 star rating and would recommend them.

                <h2>Testimonial by Jane Simcock</h2>
                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>Service provided - Loft Insulation The loft of my new property was very poorly insulated. After seeking a
                    number of quotes, I decided to go with KLC Group. So pleased I did, it was a great experience
                    throughout. Richard provided sound advice, in line with the current Building Regulations. The job was
                    competitively priced and good value.He turned up on time both to assess the job and then to complete the
                    work, keeping me well informed of his arrival time. Richard completed the job in an afternoon to a high
                    standard and with no fuss. He has been a delight to deal with - being friendly, polite, professional and
                    knowledgeable. I would highly recommend KLC Group and I will definitely be going back if I embark on any
                    other projects that come within their remit.</p>

                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>Richard and his team reboarded and reinsulated my loft. They arrived on time,  carried out the work quickly and efficiently, and tidied up after themselves . Richard has responded quickly to any emails that I have sent and he was prompt in arranging a visit to give me a quote ( which was sent immediately after the visit and came in cheaper than another quote i had been given). Based on my experience with KLC Group i would happily recommend them .</p>

                <img src="Images/splitter.webp" alt="">
                <p>What great service we have been provided by Rich and his team. From the start Rich was clear with the
                    process. No issues from start to finish and for the first time ever we were impressed with the whole
                    process. The attention to detail was the one thing I took away from this experience and would
                    strongly recommend his services.</p>
